// Your iteration statement will tell your loop what to do with the iterator after each run.

// When you reassign a variable, you can use the variable to reference the previous value before the reassignment. This allows you to do things like add three to an existing number. For example, bees = bees + 3; would increase the value of bees by three.

// Use that syntax to replace your "iteration" string with a reassignment statement that increases i by one.
